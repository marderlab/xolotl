| [The What and Where of Adding Channel Noise to the Hodgkin-Huxley Equations](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002247) | This excellent paper is clearly written and is a wonderful tutorial that tells you how to implement and integrate stochastic equations. Also comes with a fantastic MATLAB toolbox that allows you to interactively explore different models, which is available [here](http://faculty.washington.edu/etsb/tutorials.html). | 
| [Theoretical Neuroscience](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~dayan/book/refs/refs.pdf) | This is the de-facto standard textbook in theoretical and computational neuroscience. Many of the integration schemes xolotl uses are described here (like the Exponential Euler method, and the Crank-Nicholson scheme) |
