### V2matrix

**Syntax**

```matlab
	[M, V_lim, dV_lim] = xtools.V2matrix(V)
	[M, V_lim, dV_lim] = xtools.V2matrix(V, V_lim, dV_lim)
```

**Description**

Embeds a voltage trace in a LeMasson matrix, where `V` is a voltage time series
as a vector, and `V_lim` and `dV_lim` are 2x1 vectors which specify the lower
and upper bounds of `V` and its derivative.

If `V_lim` and `dV_lim` are not specified, they will be computed automatically.

This static method allows you to create a delay-embedding of a voltage trace,
and then discretize the space and count the number of points in each bin.
The resultant matrix is sometimes called a LeMasson matrix.
`M` is the LeMasson matrix, which is always of size `101x101`.
